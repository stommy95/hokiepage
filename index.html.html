<h2>My course load for the prior semester:</h2>
    <h3>Communication Law</h3>

	<p>This course was taught by the professor William Hopkins in Surge 114b. Furthermore, in this class we looked at many different aspects of the law whether it was torts, privacy, consitutional law, or just groundbreaking court cases criminal or civil. In this class we were notified of the priviledges of media and when those things do not save the organization or entity from scrutiny. Icluding areas of negligence and actual malice we were taught when those have to be proven in cases for either private persons, public figures, or public officals. This class taught me a lot of things I will use in the rest of my career in communication regardless of the field.   </p>

<h3>Intro to Communication Research</h3>
		<p>This course was taught by Adrienne Ivory in Randolph Hall on tuesdays and thursdays. This class is just as described, we were taught the history of basic research and the effects in society from those researched areas. Additionally, we were informed about the common research methods for example, surveys, qualitative research, quanititative research, field experiments, focus groups, etc. For the most part of the semester we were put into groups for projects of our own where we did our own research using surveys, focus groups, and field experiments to write up our findings on a topic given at begining of the semester(my topic was on the uses and gratifications of social media) </p>

<h3>Intro to Communication Studies</h3>
		<p>Lastly, this course was taught by professsor Buddy Howell who focused on the philosophy behind communication going as far back as mankind cares to remember. In this class Dr. Howell focused on certain eras of thinking whether it was on the aristolian or just progessive thinking. We were taught about ancient thinkers like Aristotle, paramenides, or plato. This class also described the classic struggle of the lives of men versus women. This included the original view that women's communication was either silenced or completely eradicated by men thinking themselves superior.  </p>
